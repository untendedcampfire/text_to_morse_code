Professional Portfolio Project - Python Scripting
Text to Morse Code Converter
Initial thoughts in my head, since this is just a text to morse code
Use a Json file with morse code, downloaded from Github
Ask user if they would like to type a string or parse a text file
I also want it to keep running until it is told to stop
